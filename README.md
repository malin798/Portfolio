# Portfolio

This is my portfolio, this is where I present a little bit about myself as a developer and where I show some of the projects I have been working on.


## The assignment

This portfolio was created before I learned React, and is therefore created using pure `HTML` and `CSS`! This was challenging because it demanded a really structured was of working to be able to make sense of all the code and the different sections!
